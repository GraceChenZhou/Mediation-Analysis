Imaging mediaiton analysis for longitudinal outcomes: a case study of childhood brain tumor survivorship

# Abstract
Aggressive cancer treatments that a ect the central nervous system are associated with an
increased risk of cognitive de cits. As treatment for pediatric brain tumors has become more
e ective, there has been a heightened focus on improving cognitive outcomes, which can signif-
icantly a ect the quality of life for pediatric cancer survivors. This paper is motivated by and
applied to the SJMB03 clinical trial for medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain
tumor in children. The trial collects comprehensive data including treatment-related clinical
information, neuroimaging, and longitudinal neurocognitive outcomes to improve the under-
standing of the treatment-response and long-term outcomes associated with medulloblastoma.
To this end, we develop a new mediation model for longitudinal outcomes with high-dimensional
imaging mediators. Speci cally, we adopt a joint binary Ising-Gaussian Markov random  eld
prior distribution to account for spatial dependency and smoothness of ultra-high-dimensional
neuroimaging mediators for enhancing detection power of informative voxels. By exploiting the
proposed approach, we identify causal pathways and the corresponding white matter microstruc-
tures mediating negative impact of irradiation on neurodevelopment. The results provide guid-
ance on sparing the brain regions and improving long-term neurodevelopment for pediatric
cancer survivors. Simulation studies also con rm the validity of the proposed method.
